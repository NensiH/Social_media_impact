## Description:

Since it’s a relatively new technology, there’s little research to establish the long-term consequences, good or bad, of social media use. However, multiple studies have found a strong link between heavy social media and an increased risk for depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and even suicidal thoughts. 

Here we are using social media dataset and machine learning to help determine sucidal rates. This project intends to analyze Social media use and sucidal rates across the United States through 2005-2020, detect the states where is more impact of social media usage. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com.
