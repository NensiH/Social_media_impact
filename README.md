### Selected topic
An examination of suicides across several decades, countries and generations that also looks at the correlation between social media use and suicide rates in the U.S. in more recent years among younger generations.

### Reason why we selected our topic
Social media's growing influence has completely altered the way young generations are growing up, resulting in online connections, experiences and exchanges no previous generations had access to. But a growing number of studies also link frequent social media use to a loss of sleep, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and a feeling of loneliness.

Researcher continue to study a potential causal link between social media use and declines in mental health. But internal Facebook documents published by several news outlets show that the social media giant is aware of the impact its product have on particularly young, female users.

Suicide is a serious societal problem and the result of complex socioeconomic and cultural factors. Even if our analysis should show that social media use only has a minimal impact, we believe any measure to decrease risk and increase suicide prevention is worth pursuing.

### Description of our source of data
We are using a suicide data set from Kaggle, which lists suicides from around the world by country from 1985 until 2015. The data is split by gender, age and generation, and also lists the respective country's Human Development Index and GDP in a particular year.

For social media usage, we rely on a Pew Research dataset that collected the share of U.S. adults using different forms of social media from 2005 through 2021. The data is broken down by age groups.

### Data Integration:
The Team have reviewed all the datasets listed previously, selected the main and the supporting datasets, and worked on cleaning and analyzing them. The main dataset was preprocessed and analyzed in order to test a ML model and to select the most appropriate one. We have used Python and Jupyter notebook to transform structured and unstructured data as well as data cleaning and deliver it to SQL for necessary joins and divide data into meaningful CSVs. We have then used these datasets for Tableau visualization.

### Questions we hope to answer with the data
We want to analyze how suicide rates changed over the decades and across different generations to determine specific patterns and identify high-risk groups for suicide. We plan to use two types of regression analyses to determine if our algorithm can accurately predict suicide rates among the different generations we identify.

We also want to determine whether an uptick in social media use in recent years overlaps with an increase in suicide rates, particularly among younger cohorts who use social media in the greatest numbers. To determine correlation, we plan to visualize U.S. suicide rates and social media use over time.
