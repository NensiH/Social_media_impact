## First Segment:
1 Namrata: Database: ERD, PostgreSQL setup

Sample data that mimics the expected the expected final database structure or schema
Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
2 Quang: Machine Learning pseudo code

Takes in data from the provisional database
Outputs label(s) for input data
Which model did you choose and why?
How are you training your model?
What is the model's accuracy?
How does this model work?
3 Nensi: Github

Includes a README.md
At least one branch for each team member
Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment
4 Ima : Description of the communication protocols in Technology and tools

Which tools are the best fit for your project?
What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.
How will the dashboard be built?
create a document named "technology.md" and push it up to your branch. Submit a link to your branch to your instructor during the virtual class.
